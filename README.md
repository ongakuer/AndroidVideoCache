# Video cache support for Android
[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-AndroidVideoCache-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1751)

## Why AndroidVideoCache?
Because there is no sense to download video a lot of times while streaming!
`AndroidVideoCache` allows to add caching support to your `VideoView/MediaPlayer`, [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/danikula/ExoPlayer/commit/6110be8559f003f98020ada8c5e09691b67aaff4) or any another player with help of single line!

## Features
- caching to disk during streaming;
- offline work with cached resources;
- partial loading;
- cache limits (max cache size, max files count);
- multiple clients for same url.

Note `AndroidVideoCache` works only with **direct urls** to media file, it  [**doesn't support**](https://github.com/danikula/AndroidVideoCache/issues/19) any streaming technology like DASH, SmoothStreaming, HLS.  

## How to use?
Just add dependency (`AndroidVideoCache` is available in jcenter):
```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.danikula:videocache:2.3.3'
}
```

and use url from proxy instead of original url for adding caching:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    HttpProxyCacheServer proxy = getProxy();
    String proxyUrl = proxy.getProxyUrl(VIDEO_URL);
    videoView.setVideoPath(proxyUrl);
}

private HttpProxyCacheServer getProxy() {
    // should return single instance of HttpProxyCacheServer shared for whole app.
}
```

To guarantee normal work you should use **single** instance of `HttpProxyCacheServer` for whole app.
For example you can store shared proxy in your `Application`:

```java
public class App extends Application {

    private HttpProxyCacheServer proxy;

    public static HttpProxyCacheServer getProxy(Context context) {
        App app = (App) context.getApplicationContext();
        return app.proxy == null ? (app.proxy = app.newProxy()) : app.proxy;
    }

    private HttpProxyCacheServer newProxy() {
        return new HttpProxyCacheServer(this);
    }
}
```

or use [simple factory](http://pastebin.com/s2fafSYS).
More preferable way is use some dependency injector like [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/).

By default `HttpProxyCacheServer` uses 512Mb for caching files. You can change this value:

```java
private HttpProxyCacheServer newProxy() {
    return new HttpProxyCacheServer.Builder(this)
            .maxCacheSize(1024 * 1024 * 1024)       // 1 Gb for cache
            .build();
}
```    

or can limit total count of files in cache: 

```java
private HttpProxyCacheServer newProxy() {
    return new HttpProxyCacheServer.Builder(this)
            .maxCacheFilesCount(20)
            .build();
}
``` 

See `sample` app for details.
